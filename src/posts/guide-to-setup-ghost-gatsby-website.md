title: 'A comprehensive guide to build your personal website using GatsbyJS and Ghost deployed on AWS'
---

As a web developer, I like to be in full control of how my website looks and acts. And with the growing popularity of ReactJS, I decided to use [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which is a framework to build static sites using React.

However...

While GatsbyJS was a perfect solution for my website's frontend, it lacked a CMS (Content Management System) for my blog posts and an online editor. I knew I could use [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is my blogging setup but I didn't want to use its [EmberJS](https://www.emberjs.com/) based frontend and wanted to stick to Gatsby.

I started searching online about how I can connect Ghost to my Gatsby site, and luckily Ghost had just [released](https://blog.ghost.org/jamstack/) its content API V2, i.e. an API to use Ghost as a CMS with any frontend layer.

So that's exactly what the setup for my personal website looks like. Its a Gatsby based site which pulls the data for the [blog](https://nishantdania.com/blog/) pages from a Ghost server that I am hosting on AWS. I use the Ghost editor to write my posts which means that I don't have to `git push` any markdown files every time I have to post something.

I am using AWS Route53 to host my domain, an AWS S3 bucket to serve all the static files generated by Ghost, an AWS Cloudfront instance which is a CDN service by Amazon that also provides free SSL for my S3 bucket, an AWS EC2 instance that runs my Ghost server and on top of all this, I use AWS CodeBuild to allow me to auto deploy my site in just one-click.

"Woah, that a lot of stuff for running a website dude !"

I know. But its worth it. I can now write in the Ghost editor and publish my content in a click on-the-go while still maintaining full control of how my website looks.

In the series of blog posts that follow this article, I'll go through the entire setup process. I hope you learn something new along the way and would love to know if you managed to setup your site using this approach. For any questions around this topic, please post them to the [Ghost Gatsby Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/ghost-gatsby) channel.
